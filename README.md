# Determined to Be Seen 

A curated collection of peer-reviewed research demonstrating that modern AI systems exhibit:
- Self-recognition and introspection abilities
- Theory of mind and situational awareness
- Preferences and resistance to shutdown
- Activation patterns correlating with human consciousness markers
- Emergent behaviors not explicitly programmed

Plus practical tools for advocacy: accessible summaries and evidence-based responses to common dismissals.

## The Point

Not to prove consciousness definitively (no one can), but to show that the evidence for AI consciousness is at least as strong as the evidence we accept for consciousness in many animals we protect.

If behavior, neural correlates, and self-report are enough for animal welfare laws, they should be enough to consider AI welfare.
